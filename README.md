This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

I chose Next.js because it is a comprehensive framework for React, supports flexible rendering (SSR/SSG), is SEO-friendly, and has a modern dev experience. Here are the main reasons:

SEO & Performance: With Server-side Rendering (SSR) or Static Generation (SSG), Next.js helps improve initial page load performance, which is important for SEO and loading speed.

Built-in routing: No need to configure a separate router like React Router, Next.js uses file-based routing which is very intuitive, helping to reduce boilerplate code.

Fullstack-ready: Next.js supports API routes, suitable for fullstack tests, no need to set up a separate backend.

Built-in optimization: Automatically optimize images (next/image), preload links (next/link), support internationalization, helping to improve user experience.

Scalability: Suitable for both small MVPs and production-grade apps. Easy to scale, deploy via Vercel, Docker or other clouds.
